NAME
    Test::Version - Check to see that version's in modules are sane

VERSION
    version 0.08

SYNOPSIS
            use Test::More;
            use Test::Version 0.04;

            # test blib or lib by default
            version_all_ok();

            done_testing;

DESCRIPTION
    This module's goal is to be a one stop shop for checking to see that
    your versions across your dist are sane. Please ensure that you use
    version 0.04 or later only, as earlier versions are old code and may not
    work correctly. Current feature list:

    module has a version
        Tests to insure that all modules checked have a VERSION defined, Can
        replace Test::HasVersion

    module has a valid version
        Tests to insure that all versions are valid, according to the rules
        of version method "is_lax". To quote:

        *The lax criteria corresponds to what is currently allowed by the
        version parser. All of the following formats are acceptable for
        dotted-decimal formats strings:*

                v1.2
                1.2345.6
                v1.23_4
                1.2345
                1.2345_01

METHODS
    "version_ok( $filename, [ $name ] );"
        Test a single ".pm" file by passing a path to the function. Checks
        if the module has a version, and that it is valid with "is_lax".

        Returns the following diagnostics

                FILE_NOT_DEFINED                        no $file parameter passed to version_ok
                NO_FILE: $file                          $file doesn't exist
                NO_VERSION: $file           No version was found to exist in $file
                NOT_VALID: $file $version   $version in $file is not "lax"

    "version_all_ok( [ $directory, [ $name ]] );"
        Test all modules in a directory with "version_ok". By default it
        will check "blib" or "lib" if you haven't passed it a directory.

BUGS AND LIMITATIONS
    Will not test Perl 5.12 "package" version declarations because
    Module::Extract::VERSION can't extract them yet.

SEE ALSO
    The goal is to have the functionality of all of these.

    Test::ConsistentVersion
    Test::GreaterVersion
